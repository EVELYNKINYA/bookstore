### Challenge 1
1. Input
- The function solution takes a list A as input, where each element represents the current number of bricks in a box.

2. Output
- The function returns the total number of moves made to redistribute the bricks among the boxes.

3. Calculations
- It calculates the total number of bricks in all boxes (total_bricks).
- It determines the number of boxes (N).
 - It calculates the total number of bricks needed for each box to have 10 bricks (bricks_targeted).

## Example Calls
- The function is called with three different examples ([7, 15, 10, 8], [11, 10, 8, 12, 8, 10, 11], [7, 14, 10]) to demonstrate its behavior.

### Challenge 2
1. Input
- The input is a list of integers A where (2 <= |A| <= 1000), and (-10^5 <= A[i] <= 10^5) for each element in A.

2. Output:
- Prints the pair of numbers with equal digit sum if found.
- Prints the maximum sum of two numbers with equal digit sum if found.
- If no pair with equal digit sum is found, it prints a message indicating this.

## Example calls
- The code then calls the solution function with three different lists (A1, A2, and A3) and prints the output for each.
